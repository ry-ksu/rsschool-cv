## Briefly About Myself:
I know several technologies, frameworks, databases and programming languages at an entry level, as I have been working as a project manager for 2 years. My job obliges me to know this :) That's why I often study new things in my free time. And I really like it. But I am tired of the huge responsibility that is assigned to the project manager. I would like to become a programmer and write code in peace. 

I want to do real things and offer them to the world. I am always delighted with the functionality that my team does. It's something magical! And I want to be able to do that too. My main goal is to become a good specialist, work remotely and move to Europe closer to the sea. This has become especially relevant lately. My ideal life is develop, do real projects and get charged by very smart people.
